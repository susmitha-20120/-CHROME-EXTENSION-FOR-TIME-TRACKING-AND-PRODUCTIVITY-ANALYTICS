### Description:
This project is a Chrome extension designed to help users track time spent on different websites and analyze their productivity. It runs in the background and monitors how long the user spends on each website, classifying them as either productive or unproductive based on predefined categories.

The tool gives users an overview of their daily browser activity and encourages better time management by providing basic productivity analytics.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
Frontend (Chrome Extension): HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Browser APIs: Chrome Storage API, Tabs API, Background Service Workers

### Features:
Tracks time spent on websites in real-time

Classifies websites as Productive (e.g., GitHub) or Unproductive (e.g., YouTube)

Displays a summary of time spent on each site via popup

Productivity labels for each website

Stores data locally using Chrome's storage API

(Optional): Backend integration for storing user reports and showing weekly stats

### How It Works:
The extension runs in the background.

Every time you switch tabs, it records:

Which website you're visiting

How long you stay there

Clicking the extension icon shows:

Total time spent per domain

Productivity classification

You can later integrate this data into a backend and dashboard.
